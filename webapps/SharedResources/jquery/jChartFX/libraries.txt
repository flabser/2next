     jChartFX Libraries
================================

The jChartFX libraries have been split into several .js files to provide 
granular control over what you add as a reference in your html thus allowing 
you to limit what the browser downloads when the page is accessed.

The only two files required in any scenario are:
-	jchartfx.coreVector.js or jchartfx.coreBasic.js 
	(depending on whether you want to use Vector based rendering or not)
-	jchartfx.system.js

Beyond those two, you can add or remove references as needed based on the 
functionality you want to make available on the chart.

Below you will find a complete list of libraries and their description
to help you decide whether to reference them or not.
